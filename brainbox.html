    <h2>About the YBRC Brainbox</h2>

    <p>The Yottabyte (YBRC) Brainbox project is a cloud-based
    service providing interactive computing resources to neuroimaging
    researchers.  The service provides investigators with virtual
    machines (VMs) that can access shared, network storage.  The system
    is quite flexible, and makes it easy for different projects to use
    different storage, different versions of software, have different
    users, etc.  Each VM comes with a reasonable amount of local
    storage, and large networks storage volumes can be provided by
    ARC-TS, ITS, and MSIS.</p>

    <p>A typical YBRC Brainbox VM consists of four processors, 12 GB
    of memory, and between 500 GB and 1 TB of local disk space.  This
    is a good setup for a small lab where one to three people will
    typically be working on a machine.  If a need for more processing
    or more memory is encountered, machines can be shut down and
    reconfigured without disturbing the installed software or data.</p>

    <p>Because VMs can be created relatively quickly (typically within
    one to two business days), we actually recommend that you create
    a VM per project, as that simplifies managing other things.  This is
    quite different from the past when getting new machines was
    difficult, expensive, and time consuming.  With this new system,
    you will have the choice to 'clone' an existing VM or to start a
    new one (as you might wish for a new project to start with new
    versions of software, for example).</p>

    <p>Connecting to a YBRC Brainbox is done using SSH and VNC, which
    provides a secure connection and a graphical interface.  From on
    campus, graphical response is typically very good, and from off
    campus, graphical response varies somewhat depending on network
    traffic, ISP, etc, but is usually quite adequate.  Sessions can
    be detached, and upon reconnection, the desktop appears as it did
    when detached.</p>

    <p>As of Sep 12, 2016, the YBRC Brainbox is still in pilot testing
    phase.  If you are interested in getting more information about
    the project, or getting a demonstration or trial access to one,
    please contact
