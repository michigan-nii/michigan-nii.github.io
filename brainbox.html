    <h2>About the YBRC Brainbox</h2>

    <p>The Yottabyte (YBRC) Brainbox project is a cloud-based service
    housed at the Univesity of Michigan and providing interactive
    computing resources to neuroimaging researchers.</p>

    The YBRC Brainbox system is quite flexible, and makes it easy for
    different projects to use different storage, different versions of
    software, have different users, etc. on each Brainbox.</p>

    Each VM comes with a reasonable amount of local storage, and large
    network storage volumes can be provided by ARC-TS and MSIS.</p>

    <h3>YBRC Brainbox configuration</h3>

    <p>A typical YBRC Brainbox VM consists of four processors, 12 GB of
    memory, and 1 TB of local disk space.  This is a good setup for a small
    lab where one to three people will typically be working on a machine.</p>

    If more processing or more memory is needed, machines can be shut
    down and reconfigured with additional processors and/or memory and
    simply restarted.</p>

    <p>Connecting to a YBRC Brainbox is done using SSH and VNC, which
    provides a secure connection and a graphical interface.  Sessions can
    be detached, and upon reconnection, the desktop appears as it did
    when detached.</p>

    <p>We also plan to make available configuration scripts that would enable
    someone to configure a generic installation of the supported operating
    system as a Brainbox, outside of the YBRC.  This would be appropriate
    for use on a workstation in a lab.  Only the free and open source software
    would be included to insure that licensing terms are fully complied
    with.</p>

    <h3>YBRC Brainbox software</h3>

    <p>We intend to provide a spectrum of neuroimaging software on each
    YBRC Brainbox.  As of the time of writing, the list of software includes
    Matlab, SPM 12, SPM 8, the Psychiatry Methods Core software distribution,
    FSL, AFNI, the Anaconda2 Python distiribution, R, R Studio, ANTs, and
    itk-SNAP Convert3d.  Additional software will be added as the project
    progresses.</p>

    <p>We are interested in exploring the full range of neuroimaging software
    that is available.  Many tools seem to be used primarily because they
    have been used.  It would be useful to all if we could discuss how to
    properly evaluate new tools, or new versions of existing tools, to see
    whether they should be recommended (or warned against).  What should be
    done when one software package produces results that differ from those
    of another?  How robust are the methods and their various implementations?
    Introspective topics like these are likely to become more relevant and
    important in the coming years.</p>

    <h3>YBRC Brainbox timeline</h3>

    <p>As of September, 2016, the YBRC Brainbox projectis
    still in pilot testing phase.  If you are interested in
    getting more information about the project, or getting a
    demonstration or trial access to one, please contact
    <code><a href="mailto:brainbox-help@umich.edu">brainbox-help@umich.edu</a></code>.  We expect to be able to enroll a limited number of additional test
    sites in Nov/Dec, 2016.</p>
